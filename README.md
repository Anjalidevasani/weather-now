## **React + Vite Info**

This project uses **Vite** as a build tool for React.  

Two official React plugins are available:  

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) → uses **Babel** for Fast Refresh  
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) → uses **SWC** for Fast Refresh  

If you are developing a production application, consider using **TypeScript** with type-aware ESLint rules. Check the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for guidance.
